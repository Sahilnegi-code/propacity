 First I have created SideBar Component . In the SideBar Component I have made  list for different 6 different categories   . When some user click on the section the respective page will open and show the information .This is implemented because of react-routing . When user clicks on section , the url changes its according and router throw the component according the  section that is clicked .   for Each Section , I have build different page listing and it is kept in Listing folder inside the component Folder . for Each page  , I have made different view  , one is Grid view and Other is list View and For Each  List View , I have made the components for listing    and   Grid View . Grid View is implemented in List Component .
